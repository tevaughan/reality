\section{Introduction}

For hundreds of years, a great war of ideas has been raging.  In the early 17th
Century, just as Western civilization was beginning a centuries-long program of
rapid improvement in technology, she was already suffering a deep corruption.
The West has a philosophical foundation.  It was laid in the 13th Century, when
St.~Thomas of Aquinas finished the metaphysical\footnote{%
   According to \cite{vis2017}, the word, ``metaphysics,'' originates from the
   order of the books in the traditional list of Aristotle's writings.  His
   writing on first philosophy, first science, wisdom, and theology have come
   down to us in 14 books.  In the traditional ordering of Aristotle's books,
   these came after (meta) his books on nature (physics).  These days, any
   theory about what lies at the root of being or of change is called ``a
   metaphysical theory.''%
}
project initiated by the classical Greeks.  By 1600, though, too few of the
West's brightest students had kept philosophical thought firmly connected to
right principles.  The decay began in earnest with Ren\'e Descartes.  Although
his mathematical innovations have greatly benefited technology, his
philosophical innovations were corruptions.  Their popularity led to open war
in the West against her own heart.\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter IV]{b1954} describes how Descartes divided creation into
   extended things (r\={e}s extens\={a}s) and thinking things (r\={e}s
   c\={o}gitant\={e}s). He imagined every material thing to be defined entirely
   by its geometric extension in three-dimensional space, and he imagined every
   thinking thing to have no extension whatsoever.  By denying the reality of
   whatever is not geometric in a physical thing, Descartes initiated the
   return of what the Eleatics had done: to insist that sense experience is
   essentially an illusion.  Descartes admitted that geometry is truly sensed
   and, unlike the Eleatics, he admitted that local motion is truly sensed.
   However, like the Eleatics, he denied most of what the senses report. The
   sensation of color, heat, cold, sound, taste, and smell were regarded by
   Descartes as illusions.  For him, such a sensation is due to shapes and
   motions of microscopic things and makes no direct report of any quality
   existing in the object of sensation.  This gives rise to the problem of
   qualia and to the mind-body problem, neither of which need exist with a
   proper metaphysics.
}

\subsection{The Origins of Western Civilization}

By ``Western civilization'' I mean the civilization that grew out of the
marriage between ancient Israel and classical Greece.  Like any living thing in
the world, the West has struggled to survive since the moment of her birth, but
her difficulties are multiplied because of who she is.  The Western tradition
includes bold claims about the dignity of man and about what is objectively
real.  The West has not only enemies who might naturally oppose any
civilization but also enemies who dispute her challenging claims.  In this
talk, I shall focus on the Western view of reality---in light of Aquinas---and
on a particular enemy.

\subsubsection{Overview}

Let us reflect on some points of the West's development.  First, the Hebrew and
the Greek traditions became intertwined in the writing of the {\it
Septuagint}.\footnote{%
   The {\it Septuagint} is the first translation of the {\it Tanakh} (what
   Christians call the {\it Old Testament}).  The translation, into Greek, was
   made before the Christian era.  \cite{vdh1912} provides a detailed overview.
   \cite{r2005, r2007} comments on the marriage of the Greek and the Hebrew
   cultures in the writing of the {\it Septuagint}. (I do not have page
   references because I do not have my copies of those books as I write the
   present talk.)  In at least one of {\it Truth and Tolerance} and {\it Jesus
   of Nazareth}, Ratzinger writes of the union of the cultures as a marriage,
   of which the {\it Septuagint} is the offspring. Further, Ratzinger indicates
   that the relationship between God and man is completed, in a sense, by this
   marriage, which matures in Christianity.  The Hebrew culture results from
   God's reaching down to man and man's faithful response; the Greek culture
   results from man's reaching up toward God through the intellect.
}
The two became one in Christianity, which requires both traditions in order to
express doctrine.  Christians converted the declining Roman empire to the
Faith, defended Europe against the onslaught of Muslim invaders,\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter 4]{b1938} gives a concise overview of the circumstances
   leading up to the First Crusade.
}
and finally established a new civilization, among whose fruits are modern
science\footnote{%
   The terms ``science'' and ``scientific,'' by etymology, could be misleading.
   In Latin, the verb ``scire'' means ``to know,'' but many a scientific theory
   cannot be known as a truth.  Modern science does have truths: Every
   repeatable perception resulting from a carefully described experiment or
   observation is a truth that has the power to prove a theory false, even a
   theory that had long been treated as standard.  However, a scientific theory
   that refers to something imperceptible, like the electron, might some day be
   superseded by a new theory making no reference to the imperceptible thing.
   The imperceptible thing was proposed as a possible reason for the
   perceptible result of an experiment.  The imperceptible thing's existence is
   not certain, and so the theory referring to it cannot be known as a truth.
   There are many who would claim that the electron's existence is certain, but
   such ``entity realism'' has problems.  \cite{c2016} gives an overview of
   scientific realism.%
}
and laws respecting the rights of man.  Western civilization is not identical
with Christian civilization; for example, some Jews participate fully both in
Western tradition and in Jewish tradition.\footnote{%
   Although Jewish tradition is consistent with Western civilization, Islamic
   tradition appears not to be.  A person who calls himself ``Muslim'' might
   participate fully in Western culture.  However, if his support for universal
   human rights be grounded in the belief that man is created in the image of
   God, then he participates \emph{against his own religion}, which condemns
   the Judeo-Christian idea of man.  Even if he find some other basis for
   universal human rights, he will have trouble reconciling it with Islamic
   tradition.  \cite{as2003} point out that both the Sunni and the Shiite
   traditions in Islam are opposed to universal human rights (unless the only
   humans in existence were Muslims).
}
Still, her existence is principally due to Christianity.

\subsubsection{Ancient Israel and Creation}

The story of the West begins in ancient Israel.  A fundamental idea from {\it
Genesis} is that things have not always existed.  God, Who is not a thing,
initially created things.  A new thing, such as a pot, might come into
existence by transformation from a pre-existing thing, such as a lump of clay.
However, according God's revelation to the Israelites, there was in the past a
beginning when the first things were created from nothing (ex nihilo), not by
transformation.  The fundamental distinction made by the ancient Israelites is
between God and what God creates.

\subsubsection{Classical Greece and Transformation}

Another thread of the story begins in classical Greece.  The early philosophers
struggled to understand the apparent conflict between how a thing remains the
same and how it changes.  The difficulty of understanding the apparent
simultaneity of permanence and change, of being and becoming, led some to
conclude that change is not real; others concluded that there is no permanence
at all.  On one side, sense experience was viewed as illusory; on the other
side, the mind's abstraction of the unchanging was viewed as illusory.  The
Greek philosophical tradition culminated, however, in the writing of Aristotle,
who stood up for the reality of sense experience and for the mind's ability to
abstract the permanent.

Aristotle made the fundamental distinction between actuality and potentiality.
By explaining that
\begin{quote}
   a thing changes precisely when what had existed only potentially in the
   thing begins to exist actually,
\end{quote}
he showed how both permanence (in what remains actual) and change (in the
actualization of a potential) are real. Both the mind's comprehension of a
definite object and the sense experience of change are satisfied.  This
distinction is the root of what is called ``Aristotelian metaphysics,'' and it
led to modern science, which takes sense experiences as the fundamental data in
need of theoretical explanation.

\subsubsection{Synthesis in Christianity}

When, after having been lost for a time, Aristotle was reintroduced into the
West by Aquinas, he perfected the metaphysical theory so that it could explain
not only change by transformation but also creation ex nihilo.  Aquinas showed
how, even if there had been no beginning in time, there would still be creation
ex nihilo at every moment in time.\footnote{%
   Aquinas shows how we cannot know by observation whether the universe have a
   finite age.  Only revelation can give us certainty that time began.  (Even a
   useful theory like the Big Bang cannot give us certainty that time began.)
   However, Aquinas also shows that God creates the universe ex nihilo at every
   moment in time.  So creation ex nihilo does not require a beginning in time.
   That is, God could create the universe such that it always existed, if God
   wanted to.  See the translation of the {\it Summa Theologiae} by the
   \citet[I, Q45, A1, and I, Q46, A1]{e1920}.
}

\subsection{A Recent Enemy}

The West has many enemies, both within countries formed by her ideals and
without.  Since the time of Descartes, who denied Aristotelian metaphysics, the
West has had philosophical enemies within her own ranks.  This continues down
to the present day.

A recent enemy of Western civilization is a form of atheism.  New
Atheists,\footnote{%
   ``New Atheism'' is a term widely used to refer to ideas popularized by
   Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens in the
   first decade of the 21st Century.  \cite{f2008} devotes a whole book to the
   refutation of the philosophical errors of the New Atheists.
}
such as Richard Dawkins, deny the Aristotelian metaphysical basis for
understanding reality.  Although Aristotle's metaphysical theory naturally led
to the emergence of modern science in the West,\footnote{%
   \citet[Page 36]{f2014} points out that Aristotle's middle ground between the
   apparent extremes of the Eleatics and Heraclitus is precisely what is needed
   for something like modern science to work.  Aristotle more generally
   \citep[Pages 164--171]{f2014} developed the idea of a natural substance, and
   his basic thesis was that sense observations can be used to learn about
   nature.  The incorporation of these ideas into Christianity through Aquinas
   and the Catholic Church's systematic investigation of miraculous claims, to
   see if each claim had a natural explanation, laid the groundwork for the
   emergence of modern science in the West.
}
Aristotle's opponents today ironically mount their attack under the banner of
science.  The self-proclaimed advocate\footnote{%
   Bill Nye, for example, is one of the most famous advocates of science.  Yet
   in advocating not merely science but scientism, he makes a philosophical
   error.  Bishop Robert Barron appears in a short movie in which he talks
   about Bill Nye's scientism:
   \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH_Njsa0zVQ}.%
}
of science typically holds an erroneous view, \emph{scientism},\footnote{%
   Arguably the initial, definitive use of the word, ``scientism,'' is given by
   \cite{s1991}.  My definition is essentially the one given by \cite{h2011}.
   There are many arguments against scientism.  See, for example, Thomas
   Nagel's argument from the problem of qualia, or subjective experience.
   Nagel's view is summarized here:
   \url{http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-to-imagine-consciousness},
   in his response to a comment by a professor Black.  Note that Nagel is an
   atheist, though he is out of favor with the typical modern atheist, whose
   materialism takes the form of scientism.  \cite{f2014}, in the introductory
   chapter of his book, summarizes all of the main arguments against
   scientism.%
}
according to which everything that exists is describable by modern science.  We
shall see in what follows how Aristotelian metaphysics is opposed to scientism.
First, however, we must explore the key Aristotelian distinction, which allowed
Aquinas to form a synthesis of the Judeo-Christian idea of creation and the
Greek explanation of change.

\section{The Actual and the Potential}

Aristotle distinguished between real, actual existence and real, potential
existence in order to explain both the reality of change and the reality of
permanence.

\subsection{The Eleatics}

In the Greek colony of Elea in Southern Italy---and before the time of
Socrates---Parmenides and Zeno\footnote{%
   Zeno wrote many paradoxes, but what is commonly presented as ``Zeno's
   paradox'' is that one cannot travel from point~A to point~B along a straight
   line.  First one would have to reach the midpoint~C between A~and~B, but,
   before that, one would have to reach the midpoint between A~and~C, etc.  The
   infinite regression was intended to show the absurdity of local motion.
   Zeno, like Parmenides, appeared to deny both the reality of all change and
   the multiplicity of beings.%
}
appear to have held that change is unreal.  In any change something new arises;
what is new did not exist before the change.  Denying that creation of anything
new takes place, the Eleatics, at least on one interpretation of their writing,
saw no way to explain the appearance of the new feature. It cannot come from
nothing.  So they denied that the senses are adequate to the understanding of
reality and insisted on the unreality of change.  The Eleatic view is arguably
more subtle than what appears in this characterization, but even in classical
Greece the Eleatic view was taken by some to reject the reality of
change.\footnote{%
   \cite{p2017} makes an interesting argument from Plato's {\it Parmenides}
   both for the subtlety of Parmenides' view and for the common misconception
   about what his view really was.  In any event, Aristotle argues for the
   reality of change, whether against Parmenides himself or against the common
   misunderstanding of what Parmenides' view actually was.%
}

The debate over the reality of change continues today.  Like the apparent view
of the Eleatics, a common view among physicists is that although time is real,
the \emph{passage} of time is an illusion.\footnote{%
   \cite{c2015}, for example, thinks that the ``flow'' of time from past to
   future is an illusion. \cite{s2013}, however, regards the passage of time as
   real.%
}
The universe is imagined as a four-dimensional space, one of whose dimensions
is called ``time.''  The time dimension is handled differently from the spatial
dimensions in general relativity, and so time in that sense is regarded as
perfectly real (and, at least in each particular reference frame, distinct from
space).  However, the \emph{passage} of time is like what the Eleatics called
``change'' and is now commonly regarded as unreal.

\subsection{Heraclitus}

In Ephesus---and before the time of Socrates---Heraclitus appears to have held
that everything is in flux, and nothing is permanent.  As for the Eleatics,
there is some debate about what Heraclitus actually thought.  Nevertheless,
Plato and Aristotle took him to affirm the reality of change and to deny the
reality of any permanence.  The view attributed to Heraclitus is in a sense the
opposite of the apparent Eleatic view, in which there is only permanence and no
change.\footnote{%
   \cite{g2015} gives an overview of scholarship on Heraclitus.%
}

\subsection{The Two Kinds of Reality}

In a reality that is actual, there exist other realities that are potential.
For example, this sphere of silly putty is a reality that is actual.  In this
actual sphere of silly putty, there are realities that are potential: a flat
piece of silly putty (if I squash it in one manner) and a cubic piece of silly
putty (if I squash it in another manner).  Potential realities are still real;
they really exist, though they are not actual.  That is, reality consists not
only of what is actual but also of what is potential in an actual thing.

In fact, the potentialities that exist in an actual thing are intimately
associated with what the actual thing is.  For example, this sphere of silly
putty is not potentially a solid blob that fills the room in which I am
standing.  Not every imaginable potentiality is really in a given actual thing.
One task of modern science is to find out what the potentialities in every
natural substance are.

\subsection{Change}

Change occurs whenever a potentiality in a thing becomes actual.  However, a
potential can be actualized only by something else that is already actual.  For
example, in order for the sphere of silly putty to be squashed flat, my hands,
which are actually real, must squeeze the silly putty flat.

\subsection{The Priority of the Actual}

There is an asymmetry between the actual and the potential.  One can see this
in each of a few different ways.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A potentiality is always \emph{for} a certain kind of actuality.  To
      say that a sphere of silly putty is potentially flat just means that, if
      the right external force were applied, then the piece of silly putty
      would become actually flat.
   \item A thing's potentialities are grounded in what the thing actually is.
      If a sphere actually be made of silly putty, then that limits what it can
      potentially be.  For example, silly putty of any shape will tend, over
      the course of minutes, to flow under the force of gravity, rather than to
      hold its shape.
   \item A potentiality can be actualized only by what is actual, as we saw
      above in regard to change.
   \item A potentiality cannot exist on its own, apart from something actual.
      The potentiality to become a flat piece of silly putty resides only in a
      piece of silly putty that is actually not flat.  A potentiality must
      exist only in a thing that is otherwise actual.  That is, potentiality is
      found only in combination with actuality.
\end{enumerate}
While what is purely potential cannot (outside the mind) exist apart from what
is actual, what is purely actual can exist apart from what is potential.
Aquinas shows that what is purely actual is what one ought to call ``God.''
Further, everything else (what God creates) is a combination of actuality and
potentiality.

\subsection{Causal Powers and Laws of Nature}

Whenever one thing, such as my hand, can actualize a potentiality in something
else, such as a blob of silly putty, the first thing has a causal power.  So my
hand has the power to flatten a blob of silly putty.  Apart from any human
will, a thing in the world, such as a stone, has causal powers to act on other
things and also inherent potentialities that can be actualized by other things.
The fact that everything has some inherent potentialities as well as actual
powers gives rise to patterns of activity in the world.

A so-called ``law of nature'' is not what makes things behave as they do.
Rather, each thing by nature has certain potentialities that can be actualized
and certain powers to actualize potencies in other things.  A law of nature is
what we propose in order to summarize the interactions of things according to
their natures.\footnote{%
   \citet[Section 1.2.2.4]{f2014} provides a good overview of causal powers and
   laws of nature.
}
Even in modern science, there is tacit understanding of this idea. For example,
the second law of themodynamics (SLT) is sometimes presented as a law of
nature.  However, in the 20th Century, physicists combining quantum mechanics
and statistical mechanics were able to show that SLT follows mathematically
from the statistical behavior of collections of particles.

\subsection{Summary}

In a real being, the distinction between what really exists as an actuality and
what really exists as a potentiality allows one to see how both permanence and
change are real:  Any actuality that persists has some permanence, and the
actualization of any potentiality is a change.

In what follows, we shall first consider the causes of change (or of becoming),
and then we shall consider the causes of permanence (or of being).  It should
not be surprising that of change there are two causes, one actual and one
potential; and that of permanence there are two causes, one actual and one
potential.

\section{The Causes of Becoming}

In any change, a potentiality is actualized by something else already actual.
That thing is the \emph{efficient cause}.  For example, the combination of my
two hands and their squeezing together is the efficient cause of the silly
putty's being squashed into a flat piece.

Regardless of what is between my hands, if it be sufficiently pliable, the same
combination of my two hands and their squeezing together will tend to produce
flatness in whatever lies between them.  So an efficient cause points toward a
particular effect.  In the example, bringing about flatness is the \emph{final
cause}, that toward which the efficient cause is directed.  Note that although
I probably do intend to flatten the silly putty when I squeeze it, I need have
no such intention.  If I squeeze it by habit while thinking about something
else, then the efficient cause will still point to the same result.  That is,
\emph{bringing about the final cause} is intrinsic in the efficient cause.  The
identification of a final cause in any change is \emph{teleology}, or the study
of directedness toward an end.

\subsection{Act and Potency}

Efficient cause is to final cause as the actual is to the potential.

\subsection{Secondary Causality}

According to a common misconception, teleology can be a right analysis only if
in the efficient cause there be an intelligence that intends the end.  In this
misconception, there are only two ways for a final cause to be active in the
example of the flat blob of silly putty:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item for me to desire flatness in the silly putty and for my whole person
      to be identified as the only real efficient cause or
   \item for God to desire flatness in the silly putty and for God to be
      identified as the only real efficient cause.
\end{enumerate}
In the modern misconception, if neither of these be the case, then there is no
final cause, no valid teleology.  However, the modern misconception is wrong
for at least a couple of reasons.

First, it is too restrictive to say that my whole person must be viewed as the
efficient cause of the silly putty's becoming flat.  While it is reasonable to
consider myself as the efficient cause, especially if I intend to flatten the
silly putty, it is also reasonable to consider just the minimal physical
system, consisting of my hands and the silly putty.  In each way of looking at
what's going on, there are efficient and final causes acting.  A sculptor may
be considered in one sense the efficient cause of a sculpture.  In a more
precise sense, the chisel, together with the force applied to it, is the
efficient cause of the removal of stone from the block.  Even in that case, the
application of force to a chisel always naturally tends to remove a piece of
whatever the chisel touches.  Chiseling points toward removal of stuff.  So
there is final causality even on the lowest scale that we wish to consider.
And this extends to things wholly unconnected with human beings.

\subsection{Why To Oppose Intelligent Design}

\section{The Causes of Being}

\subsection{Act and Potency}

Formal cause is to material cause as the actual is to the potential.

\section{Creation}

\subsection{Act and Potency}

Existence is to essence as the actual is to the potential.

\section{Introduction}

For hundreds of years, a great war of ideas has been raging.  In the early 17th
Century, just as Western civilization was beginning to use modern science for
rapid improvement in technology, she was already suffering a deep corruption.
The long battle to subdue her heart was about to begin.  We are even today
fighting to defend her from her enemies.

The West has a philosophical foundation.  It was laid in the 13th Century, when
St.~Thomas of Aquinas finished the metaphysical\footnote{%
   According to \cite{vis2017}, the word, ``metaphysics,'' originates from the
   order of the books in the traditional list of Aristotle's writings.  His
   writing on first philosophy, first science, wisdom, and theology have come
   down to us in 14 books.  In the traditional ordering of Aristotle's books,
   these came after (meta) his books on nature (physics).  These days, any
   theory about what lies at the root of being or of change is called ``a
   metaphysical theory.''%
}
project initiated by the classical Greeks.  By 1600, though, too few of the
West's brightest students had kept philosophical thought firmly connected to
right principles.  The decay began in earnest with Ren\'e Descartes.  Although
his mathematical innovations greatly benefited technology, his philosophical
innovations were corruptions.  Their popularity led to further corruptions and
eventually to open war in the West against her own heart.\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter IV]{b1954} describes how Descartes divided creation into
   extended things (r\={e}s extens\={a}s) and thinking things (r\={e}s
   c\={o}gitant\={e}s). He imagined every material thing to be defined entirely
   by its geometric extension in three-dimensional space, and he imagined every
   thinking thing to have no extension whatsoever.  By denying the reality of
   whatever is not geometric in a physical thing, Descartes initiated the
   return of the Eleatic insistence on the essentially illusory character of
   sense experience.  Descartes admitted that macroscopic geometry is truly
   sensed and, unlike the Eleatics, he admitted that local motion is truly
   sensed.  However, like the Eleatics, he denied most of what the senses
   report. The sensation of color, heat, cold, sound, taste, and smell were
   regarded by Descartes as illusions.  For him, any such a sensation is due
   only to the shapes and the motions of microscopic things and makes no direct
   report of any quality existing in the object of sensation.  This gives rise
   to the problem of qualia, and his dichotomy between thinking and extended
   things gives rise to the mind-body problem; neither of these problems need
   exist with a proper metaphysics.
}

\subsection{The Origins of Western Civilization}

By ``Western civilization'' I mean the civilization that grew out of the
marriage between ancient Israel and classical Greece.  Like any living thing in
the world, the West has struggled to survive since the moment of her birth, but
her difficulties are multiplied because of who she is.  The Western tradition
includes bold claims about the dignity of man and about what is objectively
real.  The West has not only enemies who might naturally oppose any
civilization but also enemies who dispute her challenging claims.  In this
talk, I shall focus on the Western view of reality---in light of Aquinas---and
on a particular enemy.

\subsubsection{Overview}

Let us reflect on some points of the West's development.  First, the Hebrew and
the Greek traditions became intertwined in the writing of the {\it
Septuagint}.\footnote{%
   The {\it Septuagint} is the first translation of the {\it Tanakh} (what
   Christians call the {\it Old Testament}).  The translation, into Greek, was
   made before the Christian era.  \cite{vdh1912} provides a detailed overview.
   \cite{r2005, r2007} comments on the marriage of the Greek and the Hebrew
   cultures in the writing of the {\it Septuagint}. (I do not have page
   references because I do not have my copies of those books as I write the
   present talk.)  In at least one of {\it Truth and Tolerance} and {\it Jesus
   of Nazareth}, Ratzinger writes of the union of the cultures as a marriage,
   of which the {\it Septuagint} is the offspring. Further, Ratzinger indicates
   that the relationship between God and man is completed, in a sense, by this
   marriage, which matures in Christianity.  The Hebrew culture results from
   God's reaching down to man and man's faithful response; the Greek culture
   results from man's reaching up toward God through the intellect.
}
The two became one in Christianity, which requires both traditions in order to
express doctrine.  Christians converted the declining Roman empire to the
Faith, defended Europe against the onslaught of Muslim invaders,\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter 4]{b1938} gives a concise overview of the circumstances
   leading up to the First Crusade.
}
and finally established a new civilization, among whose fruits are modern
science\footnote{%
   The terms ``science'' and ``scientific,'' by etymology, could be misleading.
   In Latin, the verb ``scire'' means ``to know,'' but many a scientific theory
   cannot be known as a truth.  Modern science does have truths: Every
   repeatable perception resulting from a carefully described experiment or
   observation is a truth that has the power to prove a theory false, even a
   theory that had long been treated as standard.  However, a scientific theory
   that refers to something imperceptible, like the electron, might some day be
   superseded by a new theory making no reference to the imperceptible thing.
   The imperceptible thing was proposed as a possible reason for the
   perceptible result of an experiment.  The imperceptible thing's existence is
   not certain, and so the theory referring to it cannot be known as a truth.
   There are many who would claim that the electron's existence is certain, but
   such ``entity realism'' has problems.  \cite{c2016} gives an overview of
   scientific realism.%
}
and laws respecting the rights of man.  Western civilization is not identical
with Christian civilization; for example, one might participate fully both in
Western tradition and in Jewish tradition.\footnote{%
   Although Jewish tradition is consistent with Western civilization, Islamic
   tradition appears not to be.  A person who calls himself ``Muslim'' might
   participate fully in Western culture.  However, if his support for universal
   human rights be grounded in the belief that man is created in the image of
   God, then he participates \emph{against his own religion}, which condemns
   the Judeo-Christian idea of man.  Even if he find some other basis for
   universal human rights, he will have trouble reconciling it with Islamic
   tradition.  \cite{as2003} point out that both the Sunni and the Shiite
   traditions in Islam are opposed to universal human rights (unless the only
   humans in existence were Muslims).
}
Still, her existence is principally due to Christianity.

\subsubsection{Ancient Israel and Creation}

The story of the West begins in ancient Israel.  The fundamental idea from {\it
Genesis}~1 is that things have not always existed.  God, Who is not a thing,
initially created things.

A new thing, such as a pot, might come into existence by transformation from a
pre-existing thing, such as a lump of clay.  In the myths of the peoples
surrounding the ancient Israelites, the universe had no ultimate beginning.
The pagan myth of origin, regardless of its details, describes the origin of
ordinary things as transformed from something that had existed before.

In contrast, according God's revelation to the Israelites, there was a
beginning when the first things were created from nothing (ex nihilo), not by
transformation.  The fundamental distinction made by the ancient Israelites is
between God and what God creates.

\subsubsection{Classical Greece and Transformation}

Another thread of the story begins in classical Greece.  The early philosophers
struggled to understand the apparent conflict between how a thing remains the
same and how it changes.  The difficulty of understanding the apparent
simultaneity of permanence and change, of being and becoming, led some to
conclude that change is not real; others concluded that there is no real
permanence.  On each side, sense experience was viewed as illusory in some way.
The Greek philosophical tradition culminated, however, in the writing of
Aristotle, who stood up for the reality of sense experience and for the mind's
ability to abstract from it.

Aristotle proposed that there are, fundamentally, two different kinds of
reality: actuality and potentiality.  By explaining that
\begin{quote}
   in any change, what had already existed as a potentiality becomes an
   actuality,
\end{quote}
he showed how both permanence (in what remains actual) and change (in what
becomes actual) are real. Neither the sense experience of change nor the sense
experience of permanence is an illusion.  The distinction between actuality and
potentiality is the root of what is called ``Aristotelian metaphysics,'' and it
led to modern science, which takes sense experiences as the fundamental data in
need of theoretical explanation.

\subsubsection{Synthesis in Christianity}

Working at first with translations into Latin from Arabic but eventually with
translations from the original Greek,\footnote{%
   After the fall of the Roman Empire, copies of Aristotle were not maintained
   in the West.  By 500~AD, the knowledge of Greek and the copying of Greek
   manuscripts had almost completely disappeared from the West.  Some of the
   Greek classics had been translated into Latin and survived in the West, but
   most of Aristotle's works were lost to the West.  As Spain was conquered by
   Christians in the 1100s, after about 400 years of Islamic rule, some Arabic
   copies of Aristotle became available.  A hundred years later, after the
   Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by the crusaders, original
   Greek manuscripts of Aristotle became available in the West.%
}
Aquinas perfected the metaphysical theory so that it could explain not only
change by transformation but also creation ex nihilo.  Using Aristotle's
metaphysical principles of actuality and potentiality, Aquinas defined creation
ex nihilo as the union of an essence, which potentially exists, with the act of
existence.  Then he showed how, even if there had been no beginning in time,
there would still be creation ex nihilo at every moment in time.\footnote{%
   Aquinas shows how we cannot know by observation whether the universe have a
   finite age.  Only revelation can give us certainty that time began.  (Even a
   useful theory like the Big Bang cannot give us certainty that time began.)
   However, Aquinas also shows that God creates the universe ex nihilo at every
   moment in time.  So creation ex nihilo does not require a beginning in time.
   That is, God could create the universe such that it always existed, if God
   wanted to.  See the translation of the {\it Summa Theologiae} by the
   \citet[I, Q45, A1, and I, Q46, A1]{e1920}.
}

Even before Aquinas, there was in Christianity a deep union between the Greek
philosophical tradition and the Hebrew tradition.  Although a Christian who
does not follow Aquinas may still be fully a Christian---just as a Westerner
who is not a Christian may still participate fully in Western
civilization---Aquinas nevertheless represents the union of the fullness of the
Greek intellectual tradition and the Hebrew tradition preserved in
Christianity.  In this sense, Aquinas lies at the heart of Western
civilization.

\subsection{A Recent Enemy}

The West has many enemies, both within countries formed by her ideals and
without.  Since the time of Descartes, who denied Aristotelian metaphysics, the
West has had philosophical enemies within her own ranks.  This continues down
to the present day.

A recent enemy of Western civilization is a form of atheism.  The New
Atheists,\footnote{%
   ``New Atheism'' is a term widely used to refer to ideas popularized by
   Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens in the
   first decade of the 21st Century.  \cite{f2008} devotes a whole book to the
   refutation of the philosophical errors of the New Atheists.
}
like Richard Dawkins, aggressively dismiss the Aristotelian metaphysical basis
for understanding reality.\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter 3]{d2006} tries to refute the five arguments famously given
   by Aquinas.  In the attempted refutation, Dawkins at least implicitly denies
   the key metaphysical principles of Aristotle.  Apparently unaware of what he
   is doing, Dawkins fails to say what his own basic metaphysical assumptions
   are.
}
Although Aristotle's metaphysical theory naturally led to the emergence of
modern science in the West,\footnote{%
   \citet[Page 36]{f2014} points out that Aristotle's middle ground between the
   apparent extremes of the Eleatics and Heraclitus is precisely what is needed
   for something like modern science to work.  Aristotle more generally
   \citep[Pages 164--171]{f2014} developed the idea of a natural substance, and
   his basic thesis was that sense observations can be used to learn about
   nature.  The incorporation of these ideas into Christianity through Aquinas
   and the Catholic Church's systematic investigation of miraculous claims, to
   see if each claim had a natural explanation, laid the groundwork for the
   emergence of modern science in the West.
}
Aristotle's opponents today ironically mount their attack under the banner of
science.  The self-proclaimed advocate\footnote{%
   Bill Nye, for example, is one of the most famous advocates of science.  Yet
   in advocating not merely science but scientism, he makes a philosophical
   error.  Bishop Robert Barron appears in a short movie in which he talks
   about Bill Nye's scientism:
   \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH_Njsa0zVQ}.%
}
of science typically holds an erroneous view, \emph{scientism},\footnote{%
   Arguably the initial, definitive use of the word, ``scientism,'' is given by
   \cite{s1991}.  My definition is essentially the one given by \cite{h2011}.
   There are many arguments against scientism.  See, for example, Thomas
   Nagel's argument from the problem of qualia, or subjective experience.
   Nagel's view is summarized here:
   \url{http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-to-imagine-consciousness},
   in his response to a comment by a professor Black.  Note that Nagel is an
   atheist, though he is out of favor with the typical modern atheist, whose
   materialism takes the form of scientism.  \cite{f2014}, in the introductory
   chapter of his book, summarizes all of the main arguments against
   scientism.%
}
according to which everything that exists is describable by modern science.

A key problem with scientism is that modern science is not itself describable
by modern science.  However, according to the proper metaphysical view, we
should expect modern science to provide good explanations of how physical
things behave.\footnote{%
   \cite{f2012} points out how the promoter of scientism is driven to
   adopt unexamined metaphysical assumptions.
   \begin{quote}
      [T]he distinction between actuality and potentiality, the principle of
      causality, and other fundamental elements of the Aristotelian conception
      of nature are among the preconditions of any possible material world
      susceptible of scientific study.

      That is why no findings of empirical science can undermine the claims of
      metaphysics and the philosophy of nature.  It is also why no findings of
      empirical science can undermine the Aristotelian-Thomistic arguments for
      the existence of God, for these are grounded in premises drawn, not from
      natural science, but from metaphysics and the philosophy of nature.  Now
      that does not mean that these arguments of natural theology are not
      susceptible of rational evaluation and criticism.  What it means is that
      such evaluation and criticism will have to be philosophical and
      metaphysical, rather than empirical, in nature.  Nor is natural theology
      in this regard at all different from atheism.  Atheists who think they
      are arguing from \emph{purely scientific} premises never really are.
      They are, without exception, arguing from metaphysical assumptions---and
      usually unexamined ones at that---that are first read into empirical
      science and then read back out, like the rabbit the magician can pull out
      of the hat only because he's first hidden it there.
   \end{quote}%
}
The first step in exploring proper metaphysics is to explore the key
Aristotelian distinction.

\section{The Actual and the Potential}

Aristotle distinguished between real, actual existence and real, potential
existence in order to explain both the reality of change and the reality of
permanence.

\subsection{The Eleatics}

In the Greek colony of Elea in Southern Italy---and before the time of
Socrates---Parmenides and Zeno\footnote{%
   Zeno wrote many paradoxes, but what is commonly presented as ``Zeno's
   paradox'' is that one cannot travel from point~A to point~B along a straight
   line.  First one would have to reach the midpoint~C between A~and~B, but,
   before that, one would have to reach the midpoint between A~and~C, etc.  The
   infinite regression was intended to show the absurdity of local motion.
   Zeno, like Parmenides, appeared to deny both the reality of all change and
   the multiplicity of beings.%
}
appear to have held that change is unreal.  In any change something new arises;
what is new did not exist before the change.  Denying that new existence can
arise from non-existence, the Eleatics, at least on one interpretation of their
writing, saw no way to explain the appearance of the new feature.  So they
denied that the senses are adequate to the understanding of reality and
insisted on the unreality of change; related to the denial of change was also
the denial of the multiplicity of things.  The Eleatic view is arguably more
subtle than what appears in this characterization, but even in classical Greece
the Eleatic view was taken by some to reject the reality of change.\footnote{%
   \cite{p2017} makes an interesting argument from Plato's {\it Parmenides}
   both for the subtlety of Parmenides' view and for the common misconception
   about what his view really was.  In any event, Aristotle argues for the
   reality of change, whether against Parmenides himself or against the common
   misunderstanding of what Parmenides' view actually was.%
}

The debate over the reality of change continues today.  Like the apparent view
of the Eleatics, a common view among physicists is that although time is real,
the \emph{passage} of time is an illusion.\footnote{%
   \cite{c2015}, for example, thinks that the ``flow'' of time from past to
   future is an illusion. \cite{s2013}, however, regards the passage of time as
   real.%
}
The universe is imagined as a four-dimensional space, one of whose dimensions
is called ``time.''  The time dimension is handled differently from the spatial
dimensions in general relativity, and so time in that sense is regarded as
perfectly real (and, at least in each particular reference frame, distinct from
space).  However, the \emph{passage} of time is like what the Eleatics called
``change'' and is now commonly regarded as unreal.

\subsection{Heraclitus}

In Ephesus---and before the time of Socrates---Heraclitus appears to have held
that everything is in flux, and nothing is really permanent.  As for the
Eleatics, there is some debate about what Heraclitus actually thought.  Like
the Eleatics, Heraclitus advocated the radical unity of all being, but his
underlying principle seems to have involved the reality of change.  In any
event, Plato and Aristotle took him to affirm the reality of change and to deny
the reality of any permanence.  The view attributed to Heraclitus is, in a
certain sense, the opposite of the apparent Eleatic view, in which there is
only permanence and no change.\footnote{%
   \cite{g2015} gives an overview of scholarship on Heraclitus.%
}

\subsection{The Two Kinds of Reality}

Aristotle proposed that in a thing that is now real in one way, there are other
things that are now real in a different way.  For example, this sphere of silly
putty is a reality that exists in one way, as an actuality.  In this actual
sphere of silly putty, there are also realities, each existing in a different
way, as a potentiality.  For example, each of
\begin{compactitem}
   \item a flat piece of silly putty and
   \item a cubic piece of silly putty
\end{compactitem}
really exists now as a potentiality in the spherical piece of silly putty.  A
real potentiality, despite its being a potentiality, is real; it really exists,
though its mode of existence is as a potency, not as an act.  Reality consists
not only of what is actual but also of what is potential in an actual thing.

In fact, the potentialities that exist in an actual thing depend on what the
actual thing is.  For example, in this sphere of silly putty there is not the
real potentiality of a zebra.  In this case, a zebra is an \emph{un}real
potentiality, one that is merely imaginable but not really in the ball of silly
putty.  Not every imaginable potentiality is really in a given actual thing.
One task of modern science is to find out what the real potentialities in every
natural substance are.

\subsection{Change}

Change occurs whenever a potentiality in a thing becomes actual.  However, a
potentiality can be actualized only by something else that is already actual.
For example, in order for the sphere of silly putty to be squashed flat, my
hands, which are actually real, must squeeze the silly putty flat.

\subsection{The Priority of the Actual}

There is an asymmetry between the actual and the potential.  One can see this
in each of a few different ways.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A potentiality is always \emph{for} a certain kind of actuality.  To
      say that a sphere of silly putty is potentially flat just means that, if
      the right external force were applied, then the piece of silly putty
      would become actually flat.
   \item A thing's potentialities are grounded in what the thing actually is.
      If a sphere actually be made of silly putty, then that limits what it can
      potentially be.  For example, silly putty of any shape will tend, over
      the course of minutes, to flow under the force of gravity, rather than to
      hold its shape.
   \item A potentiality can be actualized only by what is actual, as we saw
      above in regard to change.
   \item A potentiality cannot exist on its own, apart from something actual.
      The potentiality to become a flat piece of silly putty resides only in a
      piece of silly putty that is actually not flat.  A potentiality must
      exist only in a thing that is otherwise actual.  That is, potentiality is
      found only in combination with actuality.
\end{enumerate}
While what is purely potential cannot (outside the mind) exist apart from what
is actual, what is purely actual can exist apart from what is potential.
Aquinas shows that what is purely actual is what one ought to call ``God.''
Further, everything else (what God creates) is a combination of actuality and
potentiality.

\subsection{Causal Powers and Laws of Nature}

Whenever one thing, such as my hand, can actualize a potentiality in something
else, such as a blob of silly putty, the first thing has a causal power.  So my
hand has the power to flatten a blob of silly putty.  In fact, every real thing
in the world, such as a stone, has causal powers to act on other things and
also inherent potentialities that can be actualized by other things.  For
example, a stone has the power to generate ripples in the surface of a pond,
and in a stone is the real potentiality of a smaller stone, which would result
from the initial stone's being broken into two pieces.  The fact that
everything has some inherent potentialities as well as actual powers gives rise
to patterns of activity in the world.

A so-called ``law of nature'' is not what makes things behave as they do.
Rather, each thing by nature has certain potentialities that can be actualized
and certain powers to actualize potencies in other things.  A law of nature is
what we propose in order to summarize the interactions of things according to
their natures.\footnote{%
   \citet[Section 1.2.2.4]{f2014} provides a good overview of causal powers and
   laws of nature.
}

\subsection{Summary}

In a real being, the distinction between what really exists as an actuality and
what really exists as a potentiality allows one to see how both permanence and
change are real:  Any actuality that persists has some permanence, and the
actualization of any potentiality is a change.

In what follows, we shall first consider the extrinsic causes of being, and
then we shall consider the intrinsic causes of being.  Each of these is further
divided into a cause representing actuality and a cause representing
potentiality. So there are four ultimate causes of being.  We begin the
extrinsic causes because one of them is most similar to the modern notion of
a cause.

\section{The Causes of Becoming}

In any change, a potentiality is actualized by something else already actual.
That thing is the \emph{efficient cause}.  For example, the combination of my
two hands and their squeezing together is the efficient cause of the silly
putty's being squashed into a flat piece.

Regardless of what is between my hands, if it be sufficiently pliable, the same
combination of my two hands and their squeezing together will tend to produce
flatness in whatever lies between them.  So an efficient cause points toward a
particular effect.  In the example, bringing about flatness is the \emph{final
cause}, that toward which the efficient cause is directed.  Note that although
I probably do intend to flatten the silly putty when I squeeze it, I need have
no such intention.  If I squeeze it by habit while thinking about something
else, then the efficient cause will still point to the same result.  That is,
\emph{bringing about the final cause} is intrinsic in the efficient cause.  The
identification of a final cause in any change is \emph{teleology}, or the study
of directedness toward an end.

\subsection{Act and Potency}

Efficient cause is to final cause as the actual is to the potential.

\subsection{Secondary Causality}

According to a common misconception, teleology can be a right analysis only if
in the efficient cause there be an intelligence that intends the end.  In this
misconception, there are only two ways for a final cause to be active in the
example of the flat blob of silly putty:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item for me to desire flatness in the silly putty and for my whole person
      to be identified as the only real efficient cause or
   \item for God to desire flatness in the silly putty and for God to be
      identified as the only real efficient cause.
\end{enumerate}
In the modern misconception, if neither of these be the case, then there is no
final cause, no valid teleology.  However, the modern misconception is wrong
for at least a couple of reasons.

First, it is too restrictive to say that my whole person must be viewed as the
efficient cause of the silly putty's becoming flat.  While it is reasonable to
consider myself as the efficient cause, especially if I intend to flatten the
silly putty, it is also reasonable to consider just the minimal physical
system, consisting of my hands and the silly putty.  In each way of looking at
what's going on, there are efficient and final causes acting.  A sculptor may
be considered in one sense the efficient cause of a sculpture.  In a more
precise sense, the chisel, together with the force applied to it, is the
efficient cause of the removal of stone from the block.  Even in that case, the
application of force to a chisel always naturally tends to remove a piece of
whatever the chisel touches.  Chiseling points toward removal of stuff.  So
there is final causality even on the lowest scale that we wish to consider.
And this extends to things wholly unconnected with human beings.

\subsection{Why To Oppose Intelligent Design}

Formal cause is to material cause as the actual is to the potential.

\section{Creation}

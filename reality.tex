\section{Introduction}

There is a great war raging.  Western civilization is beseiged.  By ``Western
Civilization'' I mean the civilization that grew out of the marriage between
ancient Israel and classical Greece.  First, the old traditions became
intertwined in the writing of the {\it Septuagint}.\footnote{%
   The {\it Septuagint} is the first translation of the {\it Tanakh} (what
   Christians call the {\it Old Testament}).  The translation, into Greek, was
   made before the Christian era.  \cite{vdh1912} provides a detailed overview.
   \cite{r2005, r2007} comments on the marriage of Greek and Hebrew culture in
   the writing of the {\it Septuagint}.
}
Then the two became one in Christianity, which required both traditions in
order to express doctrine.  Christians converted the declining Roman empire to
the Faith, defended Europe against the onslaught of Muslim invaders,\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter 4]{b1938} gives a concise overview of the circumstances
   leading up to the First Crusade.
}
and finally established a new civilization, among whose fruits are modern
science\footnote{%
   The terms ``science'' and ``scientific'' are by etymology misleading.  In
   Latin, the verb ``scire'' means ``to know,'' but what we call a ``scientific
   theory,'' is in many cases something that can never be known as a truth.
   There are, of course, truths in modern science; primarily, these are
   \emph{observational} truths: Every repeatable observation is a truth of
   modern science, a truth at least in the sense in which the observation was
   historically repeatable, and so a viable theory must explain that.  Further,
   a scientific theory that refers only to perceptible things might in
   principle be known as a truth, if it be a descriptive theory, such as the
   arrangement of the bones in the human body.  However, a scientific theory
   that refers to something imperceptible, like the electron, might some day be
   superseded by a new theory making no reference to the imperceptible thing.
   Its existence in reality is therefore not certain, and so the theory
   referring to it cannot be known as a truth.  There are many who would argue
   that the electron's existence is certain, but arguments for scientific
   realism have problems. \cite{c2016} gives an overview of scientific realism
   and its problems.%
}
and laws respecting the rights of man.  Western civilization has many enemies.
Among them are any who would deny a key Hebrew idea, such as that man is made
in the image of the Creator, and any who would deny a key Greek idea, such as
that a sentence cannot be both true and false at the same time and in the same
sense.

One enemy of Western civilization is a particular, modern form of atheism.  New
Atheists,\footnote{%
   ``New Atheism'' is a term widely used to refer to ideas popularized by
   Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens in the
   first decade of the 21st Century.  \cite{f2008} devotes a whole book to the
   refutation of the philosophical errors of the New Atheists.
}
such as Richard Dawkins, deny both the Creator and the Aristotelian
metaphysical\footnote{%
   The word, ``metaphysics,'' originates from the order of the books in the
   traditional list of Aristotle's writings.  His writing on the distinction
   between act and potency came after (meta) his writing on nature (physics).
   These days, any theory about what lies at the root of being or of change is
   called ``a metaphysical theory.''%
}
basis for understanding reality while claiming for themselves the mantle of
science, much as the Soviet Communists did during the Cold War.  The present
talk is motivated by my interest in combating erroneous views about modern
science.  In the context of the great war and my general motivation, I point to
the philosophical conflict concerning how things really are.

\subsection{Ancient Israel and Creation}

The story of the conflict begins in ancient Israel.  The relevant idea from
{\it Genesis} is that things have not always existed.  God, Who is not a thing,
initially created things.  A new thing, such as a pot, might come into
existence by transformation from a pre-existing thing, such as a lump of clay.
However, according God's revelation to the Israelites, there was in the past a
beginning when the first things were created from nothing (ex nihilo), not by
transformation.  The fundamental distinction made by the ancient Israelites is
between God and what God creates.

\subsection{Classical Greece and Transformation}

Another thread of the story begins in classical Greece.  The early philosophers
struggled to understand how things change, and their tradition culminated in
the writing of Aristotle.  Aristotle explained that for a thing to change is
for what had existed only potentially in the thing to begin existing actually.
The fundamental distinction is between actuality and potentiality.  This
distinction is the root of what has come to be called ``Aristotelian
metaphysics.''

\subsection{Synthesis in Christianity}

When, after having been lost for a time, Aristotle was reintroduced into the
West by Saint Thomas Aquinas, he perfected the metaphysical theory so that it
could explain not only change by transformation but also creation ex nihilo.
Aquinas showed how, even if there had been no beginning in time, there would
still be creation ex nihilo at every moment in time.\footnote{%
   Aquinas shows how we cannot know by observation whether the universe have a
   finite age.  Only revelation can give us certainty that time began.  (I note
   that even a successful theory like the Big Bang cannot give us certainty
   that time began.)  However, Aquinas also shows that God creates the universe
   ex nihilo at every moment in time.  So creation ex nihilo does not require a
   beginning in time.  That is, God could create the universe such that it
   always existed, if God wanted to.  See the translation of the {\it Summa
   Theologiae} by the \citet[I, Q45, A1, and I, Q46, A1]{e1920}.
}

\subsection{Misconceptions About Modern Science}

Although Aristotle's metaphysical theory naturally led to the emergence of
modern science in the West,\footnote{%
   \citet[Chapter 1]{f2014} points out that Aristotle's middle ground between
   the apparent extremes of the Eleatics and Heraclitus is precisely what is
   needed for something like modern science to work.  More generally Aristotle
   developed the idea that a physical thing has a nature that can be discovered
   through sense experience.  The incorporation of these ideas into
   Christianity through Aquinas and the systematic investigation of miraculous
   claims (as opposed to natural happenings) laid the groundwork for the
   emergence of modern science in the West.
}
Aristotle's opponents in the present conflict ironically mount their attack
under the banner of science.  The self-proclaimed advocate\footnote{%
   Bill Nye, for example, is one of the most famous advocates of science.  Yet
   in advocating not merely science but scientism, he makes a philosophical
   error.  Bishop Robert Barron appears in a short movie in which he talks
   about Bill Nye's scientism:
   \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH_Njsa0zVQ}.%
}
of science typically holds an erroneous view, \emph{scientism},\footnote{%
   Arguably the initial, definitive use of the word, ``scientism,'' is given by
   \cite{s1991}.  My definition is essentially the one given by \cite{h2011}.
   There are many arguments against scientism.  See, for example, Thomas
   Nagel's argument from the problem of qualia, or subjective experience.
   Nagel's view is summarized here:
   \url{http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-to-imagine-consciousness},
   in his response to a comment by a professor Black.  Note that Nagel is an
   atheist, though he is out of favor with the typical modern atheist, whose
   materialism takes the form of scientism.  \cite{f2014}, in the introductory
   chapter of his book, summarizes all of the main arguments against
   scientism.%
}
according to which everything that exists is describable by modern science. He
also typically holds a dubious view, \emph{scientific realism},\footnote{%
   \cite{c2016} gives an overview of scientific realism and the problems
   associated with it.
}
according to which an imperceptible thing proposed as part of a scientific
theory is certain to exist.  We shall see in what follows how Aristotelian
metaphysics provides arguments at least against scientism, and I shall argue
also against scientific realism.  First, however, we must explore the key
Aristotelian distinction, which allowed Aquinas to form a synthesis of the
Judeo-Christian idea of creation and the Greek explanation of change.

\section{The Actual and the Potential}

Aristotle advanced the distinction between the actual and the potential.  He
seems to have done this initially in order to explain both the reality of
change and the reality of permanence.

\subsection{The Eleatics}

In the Greek colony of Elea in Southern Italy---and before the time of
Socrates---Parmenides and Zeno\footnote{%
   Zeno wrote many paradoxes, but what is commonly presented as ``Zeno's
   paradox'' is that idea that one cannot travel from point~A to point~B along
   a straight line.  First one would have to reach the midpoint~C between
   A~and~B, but, before that, one would have to reach the midpoint between
   A~and~C, etc.  The infinite regression was intended to show the absurdity of
   local motion.  Zeno, like Parmenides, appeared to deny both the reality of
   all change and the multiplicity of beings.%
}
appear to have held that change is unreal.  The general idea is that in any
change something new arises; what is new did not exist before the change.
Denying that creation of anything new takes place, the Eleatics, at least on a
common interpretation of their writing, saw no way to explain the appearance of
the new feature.  So they denied that the senses are adequate to the
understanding of reality and insisted on the unreality of change.  The Eleatic
view is arguably more subtle than what appears in this characterization, but
even in classical Greece the Eleatic view was taken by some to be simply the
rejection of the reality of change.\footnote{%
   \cite{p2017} makes an interesting argument from Plato's {\it Parmenides}
   both for the subtlety of Parmenides' view and for the common misconception
   about what his view really was.  In any event, Aristotle argues for the
   reality of change, whether against Parmenides himself or against the common
   misunderstanding of what Parmenides' view actually was.%
}

The debate over the reality of change continues today.  Like the apparent view
of the Eleatics, a common view among physicists is that although time is real,
the \emph{passage} of time is an illusion.\footnote{%
   \cite{c2015}, for example, thinks that the ``flow'' of time from past to
   future is an illusion. \cite{s2013}, however, regards the passage of time as
   real.%
}
The universe is imagined as a four-dimensional space, one of whose dimensions
is called ``time.''  The time dimension is handled differently from the spatial
dimensions in general relativity, and so time in that sense is regarded as
perfectly real (and, at least in each particular reference frame, distinct from
space).  However, the \emph{passage} of time is like what the Eleatics called
``change'' and is now commonly regarded as unreal.

\subsection{Heraclitus}

In Ephesus---and before the time of Socrates---Heraclitus appears to have held
that everything is in flux, and nothing is permanent.  As for the Eleatics,
there is some debate about what Heraclitus actually thought.  Nevertheless,
Plato and Aristotle took him to affirm the reality of change and to deny the
reality of any permanence.  The view attributed to Heraclitus is in a sense the
opposite of the apparent Eleatic view, in which there is only permanence and no
change.\footnote{%
   \cite{g2015} gives an overview of scholarship on Heraclitus.%
}

\subsection{The General Theory}

Aristotle proposed that there are not only real actualities in a thing but also
real potentialities in the thing.  Change occurs whenever a potentiality in a
thing becomes actual.

\subsubsection{Example: Silly Putty}

If I have a spherical ball of silly putty, then it is potentially flat.  If I
squash the ball, the potential flatness becomes actual.

\subsection{Causal Powers and Laws of Nature}

A so-called ``law of nature'' is not what makes things behave as they do.
Rather, every thing by nature has certain potentialities and some powers to
actualize potencies in other things.  A law of nature is what we propose in
order to summarize the interactions of things according to their natures.

\section{Efficient and Final Causality}

Efficient cause is to final cause as the actual is to the potential.

\section{Formal and Material Causality}

Formal cause is to material cause as the actual is to the potential.

\section{Existence and Essence}

Existence is to essence as the actual is to the potential.
